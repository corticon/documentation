# Java Environments

The Corticon Server for Java provides the necessary components to deploy Corticon as a REST or SOAP service on a Java application server or to deploy Corticon in-process in your custom Java application. Corticon Server provides installers for both Windows and Linux. The actual deployment artifacts - the JAR and WAR files - are platform independent.

IMPORTANT: Default application server - Corticon Server and Web Console install a standard Tomcat distribution to help you quickly get started. This is a standard Tomcat distribution at the time of Corticon release. It may not have the latest security patches or other security configuration changes recommended for production use. When moving to production, it is recommended to deploy Corticon Server and Web Console to a supported application server that you have supplied and secured. If you choose to use the bundled Tomcat in production, you assume responsibility for applying Tomcat security patches and performing security configuration.
