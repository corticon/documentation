## Designing a Vocabulary by Hand

To create a new Vocabulary:

1.	Do one of the following:
    -	Select File New Rule Vocabulary from the Corticon Studio menubar
    -	Click the down arrow to the right of the New icon
    -	Right-click in the Project Explorer to open its menu, and then choose New Rule Vocabulary.
2.	Select the parent Rule Project for the new Vocabulary by highlighting the Example_Project folder we just created.
3.	Enter a name for the new Vocabulary in the File name entry area. It is not necessary to type the file extension .ecore (we used Cargo here).
4.	Click Finish to create your new Vocabulary.
The Vocabulary is now displayed in the Project Explorer window (1), in the new Rule Vocabulary window (2), and as the open file and active tab in the GroceryStore.ecore window (3) in the following illustration.
