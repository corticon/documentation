# Corticon

Corticon, is a low-code, model-driven approach for creating and managing business rules that is targeted at businesspeople, subject-matter experts, and business analysts rather than application developers.

## Corticon Components

Corticon is broken out into rule definition and rule execution components. Rules are designed, logically analyzed, documented, sequenced, and tested in Corticon Studio, along with any configurations for accessing/operating upon external datasources.

Rules are then either:
1) **Corticon Server Deployment**: Deployed as stateless decision services on a Corticon Server, exposed as web services or embedded within a Java application. 
2) **Corticon.js Deployment**: Transpiled into a self-contained JavaScript bundle, runnable wherever JavaScript is supported.
