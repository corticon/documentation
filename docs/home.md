>Corticon is a business rules engine---a tool built for abstracting complex business logic from applications and data sources into a discrete business rules layerâ€”without coding. 

# Corticon Overview

Corticon has three main components:

- [**Corticon Studio**](https://docs.progress.com/bundle/corticon-quick-reference/page/A-guide-to-Progress-Corticon-Studio.html)
    Enables you to model, test, and automate business rules within. Progress Corticon rules can then be deployed as *decision services*, made available in nearly any architectural environment by using either:
- [**Progress Corticon Server**](https://docs.progress.com/bundle/corticon-server/page/About-Corticon-Servers.html) 
    Runtime environment that hosts deployed rule models (created in Corticon Studio) called Decision Services. Decision Services can be exposed as Web services (SOAP or REST), Java services, or .NET services.
- [**Corticon.js**](https://docs.progress.com/bundle/corticon-js-integration/page/About-Corticon.js-integration.html)
    Generates decision services as self contained JavaScript bundles, (created in Corticon.js Studio), without any external dependencies. These bundles include both the business rules and the rule engine and can be run in any browser application client-side.
