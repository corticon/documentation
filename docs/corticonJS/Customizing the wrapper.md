# Customizing the wrapper

The wrappers generated by Corticon.js are sample code with extensive comments. You are free to modify them to meet your needs, or use them as reference for integrating Corticon.js rules with other code. At their core, the wrappers all do the same things:

* Get the JSON payload to be processed.
* Execute rules on the payload.
* Do something with the result JSON payload.

In your custom code you could:

* Transform the payload, for example to make it suitable to pass to Corticon.
* Enrich the payload, for example with data you read from a database
* Store the result payload, saving the output of rule processing
* Process the result payload, for example passing it to REST service or another step in a workflow

What you do is up to you. Each of the wrapper samples provides the same logging and error handling template. You can also define a preferred logger, and set logging to debug mode. See [How to use logging and diagnostics](https://docs.progress.com/bundle/corticon-js-integration/page/How-to-use-logging-and-diagnostics.html) for details.
