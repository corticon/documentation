# Authoring the Rules

Corticon provides domain experts with the tools to define the parts of software guided by complex rules, without needing to be programmers.

Logic is authored and tested in Corticon Studio through Rule Modeling in a spreadsheet decision-table interface called *Rulesheets*.  A rule is like an ‘if-then’ statement. Each rule consists of one or more conditions (if) that are associated with one or more actions (then).
